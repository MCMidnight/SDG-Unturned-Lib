	/// Start/Stop input is encoded as 2 bits, 1 bit for Start flag and 1 bit for Stop flag.
	///
	/// Prior to 2023-03-16 it was a single bit. The server would Start if true and the previous frame was false,
	/// and vice versa call Stop if false and the previous frame was true. The problem with that approach was when
	/// the client FPS is higher than the simulation FPS a series of repeated attack presses would be treated as a
	/// continuous held attack input. Semi-auto guns were difficult to shoot at their max rate of fire. Sending both
	/// allows the server to theoretically call Start every simulation frame as opposed to only half.
	///
	/// First approach was to OR Start if held, otherwise OR Stop. This doesn't work because for example when Aim is
	/// pressed the Stop flag will already be enabled, so the gun Starts aiming, Stops aiming, Starts aiming, and then
	/// stays aiming rather than just Start and stay aiming. Instead we only want Stop to be sent once.
